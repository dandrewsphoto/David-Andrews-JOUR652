        <h3></h3>
        <p class="bodycopy">Are electric scooters supposed to be ridden on the sidewalk or the street? Is one safer than another? Are riders required to wear a helmet? Who is enforcing all of these rules and where can riders find this information?</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">Any other vehicle has clearly defined safety regulations. Cars must ride on the streets, drivers must wear seatbelts, enforced by local and state police. Pedestrians walk on the sidewalk and may only cross at the designated crosswalks. Jaywalking is enforced by local police. But for eTransit, legal language has proven extremely vague in ruling where e-scooters and e-bikes may ride, and restrictions can even vary from city to state to township.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">In their relatively short two year history, e-scooters have been synonymous with controversy. Tech companies opted to roll out scooters across U.S. cities without regulation in place. San Francisco passed a temporary ban on e-scooters in June 2018 until regulations were in place, citing a lack of helmet laws and haphazard parking that interfering with pedestrian walkways and handicapped ramps.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">This rider behavior suggests basic operating information was lacking in availability, or simply was not enforced.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">The botched rollout seems unlikely to happen on a college campus where every change is first critiqued and evaluated before implemented.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">In August, the University of Maryland installed 70 VeoRide e-scooters, 70 electric assist bikes and 150 pedal bikes at designated docking stations around campus.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">In an email statement, Department Of Transportation (DOTs) Assistant Director for Marketing and Communications Cara Fleck Plewinski says "In general, e-scooter operators and cyclists are subject to Maryland State Traffic laws, which indicates that you must ride on the road unless there's a local ordinance that allows you to ride on the sidewalk" That local ordinance is DOTs itself, which states that sidewalks should be used when necessary.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">"We encourage those using bikes and e-scooters to always wear a helmet and travel via roadways,” says Plewinski. “Sidewalks should be used when necessary, and individuals should yield to pedestrians to ensure safety." By Maryland Law, however, no one over the age of 16 is required to wear a helmet.</p>

          <h3>Downloading the app</h3>

          <p class="bodycopy">When users first download the VeoRide app, users are taken to a map and prompted to unlock a bike, and asked to grant the app permission for the camera to use the QR code reader before they are given any safety instructions. Users can click the question mark, and then click the "Vehicle How-to" option -- 2 clicks away from the home screen.</p>


          <p class="bodycopy">As shown in the screenshots below, users can select the type of vehicle they're renting, and swipe through the vehicle-specific directions. The app doesn’t mention where to ride the scooter, any helmet laws that are on the books, or any additional corresponding traffic laws users must obey.</p>

Only 3 bikers were on the street this time, and 22 were on the sidewalk. 6 of the 25 cyclists walked their bikes across the intersection, which only one person did at Regents Drive in the first study.

        <h3>Policing the Sidwalk</h3>

        <p class="bodycopy">Timothy Pilachowski, a UMD math professor, has been fighting to ensure pedestrian safety from bike accidents long before e-bikes and e-scooters motored their way into the conversation.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">Pilachowski agrees with the observational study that about 80-85% of people do ride on the street, but he's out to make sure that number is even higher as these vehicles with a max speed of 15-20 mph tango with pedestrians.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">"On campus, the speed limit for vehicles is 20 miles per hour. So these bicycles are doing car speed, or close to car speed, on a sidewalk, and sometimes weaving in and out of pedestrians. To me, that's asking for a problem because pedestrians don't walk anywhere near that fast," Pilachowski says.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">Pilachowski, who was featured in an October issue of the Diamondback, has become somewhat notorious with stopping bikers on the sidewalk and informing them to ride on the street instead.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">He's even started polling students on if they've ever been struck by a biker on the sidewalk.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">"It was 11% [yes] in one class, and 15% percent in another. If that could be extended to the whole campus, 15% of 45,000 people [who have been hit], that's a lot of people."</p>

        <blockquote>
        "These bicycles are doing car speed on a sidewalk. To me, that's asking for a problem."
        </blockquote>

        <p class="bodycopy">30 lb scooters tangling with 1 ton cars may not be the best solution either. Daniel Cutaneo, a sophomore computer science major, shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBbFa1FwAAM&feature=emb_logo" target="_blank">dash cam video</a> of a scooter rider turning right onto the street, and into oncoming traffic. That oncoming traffic was Cutaneo himself, and the two scooters collided.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">"When I'm on the roads, it kind of bothers me that these scooters break every single traffic law known to man," Cutaneo says, with his helmet sitting on top of his backpack. "And they think they're invincible. They think they don't have to stop at stop signs, they don't yield at yield signs going around a circle."</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">Cutaneo says scooters disobeying traffic laws in the streets is extremely dangerous, given the lack of protection scooter riders have compared to the cars that share the same space.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">"You're going 20 miles an hour, you get hit by something, you're going to go flying."</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">Since DOTs made the change to their policy this year to allow scooters to go onto the sidewalks as necessary, Cutaneo says he thinks riding scooters on campus has actually become safer. "Before that rule, I would always stay on the street. When I was in traffic, I would be lane-splitting. Which is also illegal and a bit dangerous. Cars don't see you going between them."</p>

        <h3>So where then should eMotorists ride?</h3>

        <p class="bodycopy">"There are a lot of places on campus where <em>bike lanes</em> could be instituted," says Pilachowski. While the infrastructure isn't in place for bikes and scooters on this campus, Pilachowski says says it very well could be.</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">"There are places that are very wide, you could paint bicycle lanes on the sidewalk and still have room for pedestrians."</p>

        <p class="bodycopy">DOTs didn't say if there were any plans to build bike lanes to accomodate the influx of transit options, but said they continue to monitor best practices to align with the university’s ever-changing community.</p>
